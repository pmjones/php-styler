## NEXT

Roughly 8x speed improvement from removing `php -l` linting in favor of PHP-Parser linting.

Cache is now ignored, though cache config remains.

Substantial improvements to line splitting and configurability of operators.

Still some problems with splitting when there are intervening unsplittable lines.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
